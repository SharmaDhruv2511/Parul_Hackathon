# Split Ride (Parul Hackathon)

Split Ride is a Mobile App build in 48 hours hackathon called Parul Let's Hack. As we have 
known that there are many people traveling to the same destination but using individual vehicle. Split 
Ride provides a platform where the Rider can offer a ride and user can accept the ride as per its suitable 
location. After reaching the destination the user can pay the ride charges using our platform wallet and 
our platform charges 10% as a platform charge. 
The project is completed regarding the hackathon but we are still working on it's improvement and 
update
